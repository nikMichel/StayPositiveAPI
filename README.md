# StayPositiveAPI

## Description

StayPositiveAPI is a simple API that allows you stay positive!


Utilizing models from Huggingface we can sent a phrase that will return a list of postive suggestions
to the end user. 

Specifically, the endâ€“user wants to provide an English sentence that has a blank or missing part, 
and receive text suggestions that can fill in the blank in a way that makes the sentence sound positive.
